# 1) Set APAPER to the path to the distribution directory.
# 2) Copy this script into some directory on your shell search path.
#
# There are two policy files, "unrestricted.policy" and
# "activee-paper.policy".  They determine the permissions granted to
# calclets. With the unrestricted policy, a calclet has the same
# permissions as any Java application.  The active-paper policy blocks
# modifications to the file system and network access.

# The following three lines identify the directory where the ActivePapers
# software is installed. If you copy this script to some other place,
# you must set APAPER to the installation directory by hand.
